### Hi there, my name is Aaron Post 👋   
🔭 By May 5th, I will have completed my BS in Computer Science at The Ohio State University!   
🌱 I’m currently learning AWS -- I just made an application called "SimpleDrive" that makes use of Cognito and S3 buckets.   
❤️ I love working on interactive software that reaches people. Though I am a programmer, I appreciate working alongside artists -- especially on Unity projects.
