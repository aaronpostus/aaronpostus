### Hi there, my name is Aaron Post ðŸ‘‹   
ðŸ”­ By May 5th, I will have completed my BS in Computer Science at The Ohio State University!   
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS -- I just made an application called "SimpleDrive" that makes use of Cognito and S3 buckets.   
ðŸ¥½ I will be starting an internship with Trace 3D shortly after graduation to work on their innovative augmented reality content creation platform, aiming to make AR tools accessible to a broader audience -- beyond just software engineers!
